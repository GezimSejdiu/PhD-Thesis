  abstract = {Over the past decade, vast amounts of machine-readable structured information have become available through the automation of research processes as well as the increasing popularity of knowledge graphs and semantic technologies. A major research challenge today is to perform scalable analysis of large-scale knowledge graphs to facilitate applications like link prediction, knowledge base completion and question answering. Most analytics approaches, which scale horizontally (i.e., can be executed in a distributed environment) work on simple feature-vector-based input rather than more expressive knowledge structures. On the other hand, analytics methods which exploit expressive structures usually do not scale well to very large knowledge bases. This software framework paper describes the ongoing project Semantic Analytics Stack (SANSA) which supports expressive and scalable semantic analytics by providing functionality for distributed in-memory computing for RDF data. The library provides APIs for RDF storage, querying using SPARQL and forward chaining inference. It includes several machine learning algorithms for RDF knowledge graphs. The article describes the vision, architecture and use cases of SANSA.},

  Abstract                 = {The management and analysis of large-scale datasets -- described with the term Big Data -- involves the three classic dimensions volume, velocity and variety.
While the former two are well supported by a plethora of software components, the variety dimension is still rather neglected.
We present the BDE platform -- an easy-to-deploy, easy-to-use and adaptable (cluster-based and standalone) platform for the execution of big data components and tools like Hadoop, Spark, Flink. 
The BDE platform was designed based upon the requirements gathered from the seven societal challenges put forward by the European Commission in the Horizon 2020 programme and targeted by the BigDataEurope pilots. 
As a result, the BDE platform allows to perform a variety of Big Data flow tasks like message passing (Kafka, Flume), storage (Hive, Cassandra) or publishing (GeoTriples).
In order to facilitate the processing of heterogeneous data, a particular innovation of the platform is the semantic layer, which allows to directly process RDF data and to map and transform arbitrary data into RDF.},

  Abstract                 = {sparql is the w3c standard query language for querying data expressed in the Resource Description Framework (rdf). The increasing amounts of rdf data available raise a major need and research interest in building efficient and scalable distributed sparql query evaluators. In this context, we propose sparqlgx: our implementation of a distributed rdf datastore based on Apache Spark. sparqlgx is designed to leverage existing Hadoop infrastructures for evaluating sparql queries. sparqlgx relies on a translation of sparql queries into executable Spark code that adopts evaluation strategies according to (1) the storage method used and (2) statistics on data. We show that sparqlgx makes it possible to evaluate sparql queries on billions of triples distributed across multiple nodes, while providing attractive performance figures. We report on experiments which show how sparqlgx compares to related state-of-the-art implementations and we show that our approach scales better than these systems in terms of supported dataset size. With its simple design, sparqlgx represents an interesting alternative in several scenarios.},

  Abstract                 = {Driven by initiatives like Schema.org, the amount of semantically annotated data is expected to grow steadily towards massive scale, requiring cluster-based solutions to query it. At the same time, Hadoop has become dominant in the area of Big Data processing with large infrastructures being already deployed and used in manifold application fields. For Hadoop-based applications, a common data pool (HDFS) provides many synergy benefits, making it very attractive to use these infrastructures for semantic data processing as well. Indeed, existing SPARQL-on- Hadoop (MapReduce) approaches have already demonstrated very good scalability, however, query runtimes are rather slow due to the underlying batch processing framework. While this is acceptable for data-intensive queries, it is not satisfactory for the majority of SPARQL queries that are typically much more selective requiring only small subsets of the data. In this paper, we present Sempala, a SPARQL-over-SQL-on-Hadoop approach designed with selective queries in mind. Our evaluation shows performance improvements by an order of magnitude compared to existing approaches, paving the way for interactive-time SPARQL query processing on Hadoop.},

  abstract = {The combination of the advantages of widely used relational databases and semantic technologies has attracted significant research over the past decade. In particular, mapping languages for the conversion of databases to RDF knowledge bases have been developed and standardized in the form of R2RML. In this article, we first review those mapping languages and then devise work towards a unified formal model for them. Based on this, we present the Sparqlification Mapping Language (SML), which provides an intuitive way to declare mappings based on SQL VIEWS and SPARQL construct queries. We show that SML has the same expressivity as R2RML by enumerating the language features and show the correspondences, and we outline how one syntax can be converted into the other. A conducted user study for this paper juxtaposing SML and R2RML provides evidence that SML is a more compact syntax which is easier to understand and read and thus lowers the barrier to offer SPARQL access to relational databases.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last years, the Semantic Web has been growing steadily. Today, we count more than 10,000 datasets made available online following Semantic Web standards.
 Nevertheless, many applications, such as data integration, search, and interlinking, may not take the full advantage of the data without having a priori statistical information about its internal structure and coverage.
 In fact, there are already a number of tools, which offer such statistics, providing basic information about RDF datasets and vocabularies.
 However, those usually show severe deficiencies in terms of performance once the dataset size grows beyond the capabilities of a single machine.
 In this paper, we introduce a software component for statistical calculations of large RDF datasets, which scales out to clusters of machines.
 More specifically, we describe the first distributed in-memory approach for computing 32 different statistical criteria for RDF datasets using Apache Spark.
 The preliminary results show that our distributed approach improves upon a previous centralized approach we compare against and provides approximately linear horizontal scale-up.
 The criteria are extensible beyond the 32 default criteria, is integrated into the larger SANSA framework and employed in at least four major usage scenarios beyond the SANSA community.},
