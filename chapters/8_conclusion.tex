In this chapter, we summarize the work done during this thesis and highlight the main results.
During this thesis we studies the research problem of efficient distributed in-memory computation and processing of RDF datasets.

In particular, we address the problems of Scalable Computation of RDF Dataset Statistics (cf. Chapter~\ref{chapter:dist_lod_stats}), Quality Assessment of RDF Datasets at Scale (cf. Chapter~\ref{chapter:dist_quality_assessment}), Scalable and Efficient SPARQL query evaluation (cf. Chapter~\ref{chapter:scalable_rdf_querying}), and usage of such scalable approaches into real-world use cases (cf. Chapter~\ref{chapter:implementation_and_use_cases}).

In the following sections, we provide a summary of our contributions and elaborate the main findings that validate our research questions.
